# üñ•Ô∏è Vis-Ad: Real-Time Targeted Advertisements using Billboard

An **intelligent, real-time advertising system** that transforms static billboards into **dynamic, context-aware displays**. By combining **computer vision** and **machine learning**, the system adapts ads in real-time based on live audience data‚Äîsuch as age, gender, clothing style, and accessories, maximising **engagement** and **ROI**.

-----

## üöÄ Overview

The **Vis-Ad system** analyses a live camera feed near a billboard, detects audience demographics and apparel features, and recommends ad categories tailored to the current frame/feed context.

Example scenario:

  - **Morning rush hour** ‚Üí Coffee shop promotions
  - **Afternoon weekends** ‚Üí Family-friendly retail ads
  - **Evening weekdays** ‚Üí Restaurants and entertainment

This repository contains the **core pipeline** to bring that vision to life.

## üí° Motivation

Traditional billboards often:

  - Use **static schedules** 
  - Rely on **broad demographic assumptions**
  - Ignore **real-time environmental context** 

**Problem:** A fixed ad rotation at 8 AM Monday is the same as 8 PM Sunday, leading to irrelevant impressions and wasted ad spending[cite: 575].

**Solution:** Our system makes billboard content **adaptive**:

  - Analyzes **audience type**, **traffic density**, and **time-of-day**
  - Dynamically selects the most relevant ad categories 
  - Enables **data-driven campaigns** that evolve with the environment

This approach bridges the gap between the digital precision of online advertising and the broad visibility of physical billboards.

## üß† System Architecture

The Vis-Ad system follows a modular pipeline with four primary stages:

### **1. Input Acquisition**

  - Accepts a **live HD video stream** (720p‚Äì1080p, 15‚Äì30 FPS) from a camera near the billboard.
  - Frames are sampled at intervals to balance accuracy with computational efficiency.

### **2. Preprocessing**

  - Detected persons are cropped into regions of interest (ROI) to focus on relevant visual cues.

### **3. Feature Extraction**

  - **Demographic analysis**: Estimates age group and gender using trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
  - **Apparel recognition**: Identifies clothing styles (e.g., t-shirts, suits, pants) and detects accessories like spectacles or purses using a multi-label CNN/YOLO-based approach.

### **4. Ad Recommendation Module**

  - A machine learning recommender system maps the extracted feature vectors (demographics + apparel/accessories) to suitable ad categories.
  - The most relevant advertisement is then displayed to the audience in real time.
